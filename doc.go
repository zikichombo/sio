// Package sio provides support for audio capture and playback.
//
// Package sio is part of http://zikichombo.org
//
// Package sio is in alpha, under development.  Playback and capture
// interfaces are more mature than duplex and device interfaces.  Linux/ALSA
// and darwin have worked on a few test systems.  This package intends to
// be open-ended with respect to platform support, hopefully one day also
// including drivers from the likes of http://periph.io as upstream providers.
//
// You are welcome to join the discussion and help us meet this goal at
// http://github.com/zikichombo/sio
package sio /* import "zikichombo.org/sio" */
